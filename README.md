# QomPy

A nice little Quantum Computing simulator written in Python. To my knowledge, this is fully functioning, having tested the Quantum Fourier Transform (and its inverse, along with each of the gates). This is hopefully a precursor to a bigger project written in Rust.

In the `tests/` folder, you will find code testing the gates that have been implemented and the source code for the library itself is in `qompy/`. The Deutsch-Josza algorithm is implemented in `examples/`.
